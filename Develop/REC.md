  To Whom it May Concern:

  My name is Joan A. Professor. I am a lecturer at the University of Washington in the Gender, Women, and Sexuality Studies department. I am writing to give you an honest recommendation for Sally Student. I have known Sally for one year. She was a student in my "Gender and Sport" class, GWSS 262, in the Fall of 2019.
  
  Sally was a very responsible student. She was a strong writer, a good collaborator on group projects, and did well on exams. She showed a great deal of interest in the subject matter of the class and came to see me in office hours to talk more in depth about things we had read or discussed in lectures. She worked well with all kinds of students.

  In summary, I am confident that Sally would make an excellent addition to your team. I highly recommend Sally Student for this position, and I wish her luck.

  Thank you for your consideration,
  Joan A. Professor, Ph.D.
