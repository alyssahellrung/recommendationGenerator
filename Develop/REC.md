  To Whom it May Concern:

  My name is Alyssa L. Hellrung. I am a lecturer at the University of Washington in the Gender, Women, and Sexuality studies department.. I am writing to give you an honest recommendation for Georgia Lawson. I have known Georgie for one year. She took my class, "Gender and Sport" in the Spring of 2020.
  
  Georgie was a very hard-working student in my class. She turned in all of her work on time, did very well in exams, and even though she had some difficulty with her first major essay, she took the initiative to ask for extra help from the teaching assistant and from me and ended up with perfect paper scores for the rest of the quarter. This shows her tenacity and determination.

  In summary, I think Georgie will be an asset to your program. She knows when to ask for help and works hard to improve all the tiem. I Recommended Georgia Lawson for this position, and I wish her luck.

  Thank you for your consideration,
  Alyssa L. Hellrung, Ph.D.
